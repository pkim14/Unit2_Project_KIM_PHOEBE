LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
    private int x: this variable represents the x-coordinate (user input)
    private int y: this variable represents the y-coordinate (user input)
    private int x2: this variable represents the new x-coordinate (user input)
    private int y2: this variable represents the new y-coordinate (calculated)

Constructor
    public LinearEquation(int x, int y, int x2, int y2)

Methods
    public String toString()
        This method will display all relevant information the instance including:
            - x and y coordinate information
            - slope intercept form equation

    public String Slope()
        This method will calculate the slope of the linear equation using the two given x and y coordinates
            - returns a string with a fraction (a/b)
            - uses (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)

    public String Intercept()
        This method will calculate the y-intercept of the linear equation using the two given x and y coordinates
            - returns a string with the fraction (a/b)

    public double Distance()
        This method will calculate the distance between the two points using the distance equation
            - uses √ (x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²
            - returns a double

    public String NewY()
        This method calculates the y-coordinate of the new x-coordinate the user inputted
            - inputs the x-coordinate into the linear equation to find the y-coordinate


EquationRunner.java

Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 3: Create a new object using LinearEquation class
Step 4: Run each method with the new object
Step 5: Ask user to enter a new x-coordinate in order to calculate the value of the y-coordinate
Step 6: Print the new coordinate
